# System Modeling And Simulation (SMS)
**SMS Lab programs written in python for Modelling and Simulation Lab**

1. Write a program to simulate the average waiting time of the customer in the **single server queueing system.**

2. Write a program to simulate the multi-channel **dump truck system** consisting of 6 trucks, 2 loaders and 1 scale. Consider the standard initial assumptions. Calculate the server utilizations for a simulation period of 72 minutes

3. Write a program to show goodness of fit test using **Kolmogorov Smirnov Test** for the given population of random numbers. Assume significance value is equal to 0.05. Dcritical = 0.565

4. Write a program to show goodness of fit test using **Chi-Square Test** for the input set of random numbers. Assume significance value is equal to 0.05. Dcritical = 16.9

5. Write a program to show goodness of fit test using **Autocorrelation test** for the input set of random numbers. Assume ZÎ±/2=1.96
